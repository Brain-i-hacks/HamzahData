# HamzahData
Analysis of Hamzah's EEG stuff




## CSV files
The csv files were separated in 4 groups:
- Adaptive condition first : first trial (Adaptive)
- Adaptive condition first: second trial (Random)

### Warning! If you used these files before 23-2-2023 they were a copy of the same file! Now it should be fixed however
- Random condition first : first trial (Random)
- Random condition first: second trial (Adaptive)

I did not use any artefact removal, these files contain the EEG Engagement per second
You can check HamzahFilecleaning.ipynb to see what I did exactly
Though you may need the filestructure which is on drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/12bCWViuPd49zXbTKDgxbzgu8_YZYNY6J
